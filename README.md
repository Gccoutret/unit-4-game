Homework 4 crystal game

In this game, you are given an initial target value. Your goal is to use the crystals, which will each randomly get a value between 1 and 12, to reach the target value. 

If you reach the target value, you are awarded a win. If you go over, you are given a loss. 

Whenever you win, lose, or load the page, the target value and the value of each crystal will randomize. 

Can you reach the target value?
